# Unreal Engine Live Project - Code Summary
## Introduction
I worked in an Agile/Scrum environment to build a game in Unreal Engine using C++ and blueprints. I created a puzzle escape game in a dungeon setting from a first person perspective and a 3d environement using the assets at my disposal. We used Azure DevOps to manage our repositories and user stories. I developed a productive workflow after familiarizing myself with the tools at my disposal. Over the two week sprint I had many opportunities to learn what it means to work as part of a team on a single project.

Here are some of the highlights from the project:



## Story 1: Plan, Design, and Block In
Before I began, I created an outline, I made a list of things I planned to include in my game. This included: "What puzzles did the player have to solve?", "What hazards and obstacles would the player have to avoid?", "What sort of atmosphere do I want the player to experience?", and "What were the win conditions for the level". Once I have a basic idea about what I wanted things to look like. I created a large room with space for each of the puzzles and traps using brushes.


## Story 2: Finalize Level With Meshes
I replaced my rough draft with meshes from the content browser. I began forming the where each of the puzzles would take place, the end goal for the player, and some basic lighting and style choices.


## Story 3: Puzzles
In this story, I began diving into blueprints and working out the details of each puzzle. 

I created a mechanic a prominent location in the level where the player would have to decipher 3 instructions, each corresponding to a puzzle.

Solving each puzzle would give the player a location to place a pillar to unlock the gate leading to the exit to win the game.

In the first puzzle, the player would interact with a statue, which would then disappear and reappear elsewhere on the map. The player would continue to locate the statues' new locations until arriving at the final location which lead them to an answer.

In the second puzzle, the player would perform precise jumps in a jumping puzzle in order to discover the location of another answer.

In the final puzzle, the player must find 3 bones hidden in the dungeon and place them in the correct location in order to gain safe access to the final answer.

## Story 4: Traps
Each of the puzzles, if solved incorrectly, would result in the death of the player. These traps included: Lava, poisonous potions, and a creature looming the dark.

## Story 5: Final Touches
I made some final touches to my game, including sound effects and ambience, decorating with additional meshes, lighting touchups and settings, and bug fixes.

After having multiple people playtest my game I determined that the level should be more easily understandable and user friendly, so I made some changes to make it more accessible.
